creatures.js
============

A canvas based digital "goldfish bowl" or artificial life sim.
--------------------------------------------------------------

The main goal of this project is to create an environment where "creatures" live, evolve and interact with each other and their environment.


### creature behaviour

The intention is to provide creatures with the ability to :

 * move ✔✅
 * eat / hunt ✅
 * poo, yes i said poo.
 * breed
 * sense ✅ (to a degree)
 * interact with their environment
 * ideally evolve over time

### environment

Ideally the environment / habitat / ecosystem should be set up with similar variables to that of a real-life habitat such as physical barriers and environmental parameters that affect the creatures themselves and the resources they rely on. It would be cool to lnclude "seasons", "rainfall" / "drought" etc.  But we'll se how we get on with the first bit.
